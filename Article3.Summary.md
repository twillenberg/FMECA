The paper "Evaluation of a Cyber Risk Assessment Approach for Cyber-Physical Systems" presents a comprehensive evaluation of the Failure Modes Effects and Criticality Analysis combined with the Adversarial Tactics, Techniques, and Common Knowledge (FMECA-ATT&CK) approach. This novel methodology is applied for assessing cyber risks in cyber-physical systems (CPSs), specifically focusing on two use cases: an Autonomous Passenger Ship (APS) and a Digital Substation (DS).

FMECA-ATT&CK integrates the FMECA risk assessment process with the detailed and encoded knowledge in the MITRE ATT&CK framework. This approach reduces the reliance on expert judgment, aiming to decrease bias and increase efficiency in risk assessment. The evaluation methodology aligns with ISO 15288:2015 and IEC 31010:2019 standards and uses the Bow-Tie approach as a comparison basis.

The APS use case involves various components like Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) and video cameras linked to a local navigation and control system, illustrating the complexity of modern maritime CPS. The DS use case represents the energy domain, incorporating components like a Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system, data historians, and intelligent electronic devices (IEDs).

The evaluation process included preparing the scope, objectives, and requirements; determining the evaluation procedure; identifying stakeholders; and preparing data and systems for the assessment. This preparation involved both academic and industrial subject matter experts (SMEs) to ensure a comprehensive evaluation.

The execution of the evaluation took place over several sessions, involving the Bow-Tie and FMECA-ATT&CK methods. The tasks for conducting FMECA-ATT&CK were compiled in an Excel worksheet, and the Bow-Tie tasks were communicated in meetings. The results from these sessions were then consolidated and compared for evaluating the soundness of FMECA-ATT&CK.

The evaluation showed that both Bow-Tie and FMECA-ATT&CK methods are categorically compatible, with FMECA-ATT&CK identifying similar risks to Bow-Tie but with more defined atomic techniques. The highest risks identified through FMECA-ATT&CK aligned with those identified through Bow-Tie, although some threats identified through Bow-Tie were considered low risks in FMECA-ATT&CK due to the consideration of existing mitigation measures.

Additionally, the evaluation explored the attacker objectives and expected consequences in the evaluated systems. The results suggested alignment in the identified possible consequences in both use cases, with some consequences from Bow-Tie being medium to low risks in FMECA-ATT&CK due to existing risk mitigation measures. FMECA-ATT&CK also identified additional objectives not covered by Bow-Tie.

Overall, the paper demonstrates the effectiveness of FMECA-ATT&CK in cyber risk assessment for CPSs, highlighting its applicability, feasibility, accuracy, comprehensiveness, adaptability, scalability, and usability. The evaluation also identified areas for improvement, emphasizing the utility of a standard-aligned evaluation method in thoroughly assessing cyber risk assessment approaches.
