## Abstract

The paper titled "Assessing Cyber Risks in Cyber-Physical Systems Using the ATT&CK Framework" focuses on the safety and security implications of Autonomous Passenger Ships (APSs) in urban waterways. The study utilizes a Failure Modes Effects and Criticality Analysis (FMECA) enhanced with the MITRE ATT&CK framework and graph theory-based metrics to assess cyber risks in these systems. The primary objective is to analyze threats endangering passengers and the operational environment of APSs, identifying potential risks and proposing mitigation methods.

The introduction highlights the increasing attention towards automated and autonomous ships and the potential cybersecurity risks due to enhanced connectivity and reduced human supervision. This section underscores the necessity of risk management in APS communication architecture to ensure the safety and security of both passengers and the operational environment.

The paper employs FMECA for risk assessment, integrating the MITRE ATT&CK framework to identify and describe attacks' techniques and tactics. This combination aims to overcome limitations in existing risk assessment methods, providing a comprehensive analysis of the risks. Additionally, graph theory concepts are used to estimate the impact of identified risks.

Section 2 of the paper provides background information on APSs, their communication architecture, and the relevance of the MITRE ATT&CK framework and graph theory in this context. It describes the communication architecture of an APS prototype, highlighting its autonomous and remote navigation and control capabilities.

The proposed risk assessment approach detailed in the paper involves specifying components and their functions, identifying relevant failure modes, detecting methods, existing controls, and estimating the impact of consequences of each failure mode. This approach is systematic and comprehensive, considering multiple aspects such as safety, financial, operational, and information criticality. Special emphasis is placed on the integration of the ATT&CK framework in identifying failure mechanisms, considering it a comprehensive source for attack identification.

In summary, the paper offers a detailed methodology for assessing cyber risks in Cyber-Physical Systems like APSs, leveraging the ATT&CK framework and graph theory. This approach enhances the understanding of safety and security implications in such systems and contributes to developing robust risk management strategies.
